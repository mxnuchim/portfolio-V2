# portfolio-V2
Here lies the code for my second portfolio website.
This is easily the work I'm most prouf of because of how much time and effort I put into it
The website was built using Next JS and SASS and the animations were created using Framer Motion
All of the content is managed using sanity
Feel free to fork, copy and work on it. Thanks!
